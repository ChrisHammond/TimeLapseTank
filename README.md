TimeLapseTank
=============

A Netduino powered tracked vehicle (tank) designed to carry a GoPro along a straight route shooting a series of photos to be used in a time lapse video.

Right now the project is designed to take the tank in forward and reverse, in 4 second intervals, to create movement in a timelapse video.

I'll update this project more when I have some more testing and usage completed.
